# SWDA - Backbone Stack

## Contents
* **bus**: RabbitMQ as messaging system. Our microservices communicate over this bus. Username: **swda** / password: **swda** 
* **portainer**: A web-based tool to monitor all your docker artefacts such as containers, networksâ€¦.
* **mongodb**: A nosql database to store data. No actively used, just for your convenience.
* **mongo-viewer**: A webbased DBMS for the mongo-db to view and modify the database content. 
---
Additionally, there are some demo services in this stack. They comumnicate with each other over the bus and demonstrate the basic usage. These demo services can be removed.

## Usage - local development
Start the services using docker-compose:

```docker-compose -f stack.local.yml up```
   
Ensure all services (containers) are running:
   
```docker-compose -f docker-compose.local.yml ps -a```

Display the logs of all services:

```docker-compose -f docker-compose.local.yml logs -f```

...or of a single service:

```docker-compose -f docker-compose.local.yml logs -f bus```

## Accessing the endpoints - local development
The services run in virtual networks, but their endpoints are mapped to the host network using port mapping:

```bash
bus:
  ports:
    - "8082:15672"
```

The web interface of RabbitMQ (bus) runs on port **15672** in the virtual network. The endpoint is mapped to port **8082** in the host network. Hence, it can be accessed on this URL:

```http://localhost:8082```

# Auth
If you receive an unauthorized access denied error, then login to the container registry first.
Maybe this only works in CMD instead of the integrated terminal in VS Code!

```docker login cr.gitlab.switch.ch```

Use your username and a generated access token as credentials:
* gian.ott
* glpat-_xyzxyzxyzxyzxyz
